# Pseudomonas Genome Analysis  
Pseudomonas is a species of unicelular organisms that can be found living in various environments (i.e. in dairy products, hospital surfaces, soil, and water).
Certain subspecies of Pseudomonas are known to degrade toxic compounds that are produced as a by-product in the oil refining process. These compounds are called Naphthenic acids, and they are very toxic to the natural environment. The purpose of this project is to compare and analyse the genomes of Pseudomonads cultured in the lab, with data from worldwide biological databases, such as https://www.pseudomonas.com/, and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ 

In this folder, I will be analysing and comparing the genomes of different subspecies of Pseudomonas. The data in this folder consists of tables of gene islands on which analysis will be done until the genes responsible for the degradation of Naphthenic Acids are uncovered.
