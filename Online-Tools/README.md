# Bioinformatics-Productivity-Scripts
This repository will contain python scripts that will enhance the productivity of bioinformatic data analysis by automating processes such as batch submission, and file conversion. This repository will be dynamically updated as I learn more about different tools used in bioinformatic analysis, and as I think of new ideas.
Additional libraries required for the execution of scripts will be outlined in the readme files of individual folders.

In general the following libraries will be a requirement for all scripts:
* BioPython
* NumPy
